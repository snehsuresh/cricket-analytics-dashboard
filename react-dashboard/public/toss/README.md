This is the code and data for a cricket interactive to be published on [wionews.com](http://www.wionews.com).

All the data is courtesy of [CricketArchive.com](https://www.cricketarchive.com), but any errors in analysis are my own.

This story is a follow-up to a [data story](http://www.wionews.com/cricket/is-the-t20-format-ruining-test-cricket-14150) on Test cricket published on April 5, 2017.

Used a modified version of Adam Pearce's [Graph-Scroll.js library](1wheel.github.io/graph-scroll/) to make this interactive. 

(To be honest, this is not so much an interactive but more an animated slideshow with d3 snippets thrown in, but I'm ok with that for now!)

Apart from the Graph-Scroll.js library, I also used Gregor Aisch's [d3 jetpack](https://github.com/gka/d3-jetpack) and the [d3-geo microlibrary](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo).

If you want to know how I analysed the data, the [ipython/jupyter notebook](ipython_notebook_used_for_analysis.ipynb) I used is available in the repository.

Finally, thanks to Rustam Roy and Agnisheik Chatterjee of WION for helping me understand how pitch conditions impact Test matches, and also to Saurabh Singh of OPEN magazine for helping me improve some of the images.
